##C++ JIT Interpreter
This interpreter aims to provide a JIT interpreter for a subset of C++11, with support for features such as
lambdas and templates.

##Rationale
- Users shouldn't have to pre-process, compile and link their respective programs to verify their understanding
of C++11 language features.
- The C++ syntax is favoured by many, and therefore familiar to most developers.
